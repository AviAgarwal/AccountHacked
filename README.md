# AccountHacked
The "Open Letter to Apple" posted on my account was not posted by me! An individual who has been trying to get me fired for over a month now posted it trying to ruin my early career! In the last month this individual has hacked my facebook, gmail, emailed my boss trying to convience him to fire me, and now wrote this "Open Letter" as an attempt to discredit and deface my name. I'd like to apologize if that letter caused any harm or offended anybody, I just want to reassure everyone that the letter was not written by me and does not at all reflect my political beliefs nor does it depict Apple's reality. Sorry again and thank you everyone for understanding.
